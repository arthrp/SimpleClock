SimpleClock
===========

Very short sample Pocketbook app, showing current time and date.

It's 2 times smaller and more simple, as it uses standard library functions
and outputs digits as text, instead of some obscure bitmap manipulations.
Also: almost no magic numbers, self-documented code, simple program flow, etc, etc ;)
